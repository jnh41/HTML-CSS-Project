  <h2 align=center>Website Details</h2>
  <p>In constructing this website, it is essential that it is well-organized. Therefore, I intend to have a top menu bar, much like the one I included on this website, that will allow users ease in navigation. The following tabs will be included:
  </p>
    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="box">
        <p><u>Home</u></p>
      </div>
    </div>
      <p>The "Home" page will be the default page. It will show the most recent posts, or allow you to filter by popularity (number of hits), alphabetically, or recency.
      </p>
      <div class="flex-container">
    <div class="box">
      <p><u>About</u></p>
    </div>
  </div>
      <p>The "About" section will give general information on this blog and how to navigate it.
      </p>
      <div class="flex-container">
    <div class="box">
  <p><u>Find</u></p>
    </div>
  </div>
      <p>The "Find" section will have a search engine to allow a user to find more specfic posts. There will be a number of categories listed via a drop down box. This might include location, genre of posts, photography, etc. Bloggers must use tags in their posts to allow for more specificty for the search engine. You will also have the option of organzing the posts by date, popularity, or alphabetically.
      </p>
<div class="flex-container">
    <div class="box">
  <p><u>Gallery</u></p>
    </div>
  </div>
      <p>The "Gallery" section will display all the pictures collected from individual posts. It will give the option to sort by location.
      </p>
    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="box">
      <p><u>Contact</u></p>
      </div>
    </div>
      <p>The "Contact" section will give a form (essentially like a google docs form) to allow any viewer to contact the owner of the website to provide comments, questions, or recommendations.
