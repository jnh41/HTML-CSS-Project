<h2>The Pitch</h2>
<p>Something Iâ€™ve always wanted to do is visit all the national parks. Of course, out of the 59 that exist, I've only been to three. Basically, while I'm not achieving this goal anytime soon, that doesn't mean I shouldn't start looking into it.
</p>
    <p>
So for my project proposal, I am pitching a blog that is <b>all about National Parks!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
My desired goal is to give fellow travel enthusiasts an outlet to share ideas, pictures, and whatever they feel is relevant to a specific national parks, or national parks in general. This is intended to be more informal than the actual <a href="https://www.nps.gov/index.htm">national park website</a>, mainly giving people an outlet to share their experiences.
Much like our class website, people will have the ability make posts and categorize information. This will be done by establishing categories, much like how on WordPress gives us the ability to categories our posts into reflections, for instance. Tags will also be essential to sort the elements of the posts as well.
